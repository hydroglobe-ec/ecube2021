This is a demo of the HydroGlobe tool for the EarthCube 2021 Annual Conference.

Satellite remote sensing data provide critical information on earth observations that can be used for water resources applications. However, these data require lot of time and computational resources to obtain and pre-process due to their global coverage, heterogeneous formats and inconsistent spatial resolution. HydroGlobe, a Jupyter Notebook tool and deployed in MyGeoHub, alleviates these issues by minimizing the processing tasks and delivering ready-to-use earth observation data for hydrologic models. It connects to Purdueâ€™s HPC (High Performance Computing) resources to create spatially averaged time series of earth observations data for user specified spatial extent. HydroGlobe supports multiple data sources including surface and root zone soil moisture data from SMAP, evapotranspiration and leaf area index data from MODIS, and precipitation data from GPM. Jupyter Notebook was originally developed for sharing documents containing live code and simple visualization, which is often restrictive in user experience (UX) for non-programmers. In this presentation, we will present HydroGlobe as an example for making the notebook a stand-alone web application providing better UX. We utilized the jQuery JavaScript library to enhance the default Jupyter widgets, to provide extended user interface (UI) elements such as dialog box or loading indicator, and to support data download. An enhanced file upload widget was implemented to transfer large input files efficiently. HydroGlobe provides interactive map-based visualization using the Leaflet JavaScript library. Although Leaftlet has been imported to Jupyter widgets as ipyleaflet, it has limited functionalities. Instead of using ipyleaflet , we directly imported Leaflet via the Folium Python module and enhanced it by adding new features such as supporting heatmap, large-sized map data, and flexible UI components. Lastly, qgrid widget was applied to support an interactive data table. Using HydroGlobe, anyone can get remote sensing data in a user-friendly format with just a few clicks without any computational demand.
